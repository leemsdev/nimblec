- decided 1 line per statement
- statements must begin with (ident, if, for, fn_call)

im thinking in codegen we should be able to just call a function which returns the allowed next tokens AND the error to
print if it doesn't match. do that after if statement. and then there's just a lookup. like:

if -> lookup if_rules -> return ident -> lookup ident_rules -> return == -> lookup === rules -> return ident

if we fail at any stage we can return the error that should be printed w/ the exact line (literally the source printed with a ^
pointing to the error loc) and if we succeed then we return the literal value of that part so we can construct it

maybe even each stage of the process can take in the output and do it's own appending onto the output, meaning each rules handler is
responsible for writing its output

tho this would mean that the code generation would be done WHILE creating the ast (which isnt even rly an ast here so wtf am i doing)

wait scratch the above. we do a chain. if it fails then we get the err back instead. this is a good idea. 
if it passes we get back a vector of all the relevant tokens
so it's one top level call, then
it goes through a chain of functions and appends to the expr or fails at some stage. but each step advances the 
token_iter. 

this could be a builder struct too. so you construct grammar like:

```
vec<token> then_toks = parse_grammar()
	.expect({ident})
	.expect({eqeq})
	.expect({bool, ident, number, string})
	.expect({then})
	.expect({keyword_print})
	.validate();
```

and we could even make this composable, so you can have nested grammar trees.
this is good!! this is like just using BNF but in code.
it will make constructing grammar way faster.
(tho this is just becoming nimble now lol)


im also using statements wrong. i cant afford to have just 1 statement type. i need to add more.
fix this once you've got it working cos it's bad. we need like if_stmt, fn_stmt, for_stmt etc. and then
each of those statements can have child expressions.

so like, just statement container. expressions can be attached to statements by value.
